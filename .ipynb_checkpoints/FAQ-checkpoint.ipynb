    "Basically it is just trial and error. Those are called hyperparameters and should be tuned on a validation set (split from your original data into train/validation/test).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning just means trying different combinations of parameters and keep the one with the lowest loss value or better accuracy on the validation set, depending on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grid search: For each parameter, decide a range and steps into that range, like 8 to 64 neurons, in powers of two (8, 16, 32, 64), and try each combination of the parameters. This is obviously requires an exponential number of models to be trained and tested and takes a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random search: Do the same but just define a range for each parameter and try a random set of parameters, drawn from an uniform distribution over each range. You can try as many parameters sets you want, for as how long you can. This is just a informed random guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there is no other way to tune such parameters. About layers having different number of neurons, that could come from the tuning process, or you can also see it as dimensionality reduction, like a compressed version of the previous layer."
